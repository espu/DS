Injection
</h4>
<h6> Reference: https://owasp.org/Top10/A03_2021-Injection/ </h6>

<p>
  
 - A code injection technique used to modify or retrieve data from SQL databases by sending statements that are not validated, filtered, or sanitized by the server or application.
  
 - Common injection targets are SQL, NoSQL, OS command, Object Relational Mapping (ORM), LDAP, and Expression Language (EL) or Object Graph Navigation Library (OGNL)
  
 - Prevention requires keeping data separate from commands and queries, as well as automated testing of all parameters, headers, URL, cookies, JSON, SOAP, and XML data inputs by using server-side input validation, API's that avoid the use of interpreters, limiting the amount of data that can be requested or other
  
 - Application security testing tools like static (SAST), dynamic (DAST), and interactive (IAST) can be used in the CI/CD pipeline to identify flaws before they are deployed
