<h3> Jackpotting ATM's (Automated Teller Machines) - Its easier than you might think - Alexander Forbes </h3>
<h6> Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThPJrPf7O2s </h6>

  - Alexander Forbes presentation consists of:
    - A brief history of ATMs
    - What a modern ATM consists of
    - The attack surfaces of modern ATMs
    - Protection, detection and response mechanisms
    - Attacks which have succeeded
    - Lessons to be learned
  
Notes
  - Today there are only a limited number of ATM vendors and suppliers such as Diebold-Nixdorf, NCR, Triton and Hitachi in the USA
  - The decreasing amount of vendors is fantastic news for attackers as just one attack vector can scale up to many devices
  - ATMs mostly consist of user interactive components(e.g. PIN-entry PAD, Touchscreen, Card reader, Audio-jack for impaired users), sensors (e.g. camera, microphone, case, tamper switches, motion sensors and other), and other hardware 
  - Many ATMs use 32-bit versions of Windows 7 or even Windows Vista/XP
  - Non-ATM attack surface may be the customers, who are targeted by skimming, shoulder-surfing, cash-in-transit robbery or other ways
  - ATM attack surfaces may be:
    - Physical = breaking into the safe or cash cassettes using heavy equipment,      explosives, or stolen safe codes
    - Network = intercepting MiTM connections, logging traffic or attacking ATM network services
    - Embedded systems
    - ATM hardware components (custom controllers attached to USB)
  - ATM vendors are aware of flaws, but often don't do enough to protect from simple attacks
  - Protection failures that Alexanders determined:
    - Physical:
      - ATMs are heavy, but can be moved with enough man power
      - Often not monitored at night even with CCTV and secured locations
      - The cases used are thin sheet metal with pre-drilled holes or spaces that can contain additional hardware
      - There are easily broken locks in place to gain access to the internals
      - Network cables are sometimes accessible externally
    - Network:
      - Use of private APN or VPN that aren't secured through authentication
      - Use of networking gear that hasn't been updated
      - Use of firewalls that don't block services well enough
    - Embedded systems:
      - No whole disk encryption of the drive
      - Missing software protection such as policies or anti-malware
    - Hardware components
      - Authentication between the cash-dispenser and ATM software allows for the use of plain-text commands
      - No mutual athentication of other hardware (e.g. PIN Pad, Card Reader, etc.)
      - Plenty of room for malicious devices that can access wires and exposed components
  - To protect the ATMs, he advises vendors and suppliers to:
      - pay security experts to support the design process and set up of the machines in production
      - using reliable security software and networking gear from trusted brands
      - implementing full disk encryption
      - hiding exposed cables and components
      - using external CCTV cameras
      - minimizing the systems' attack surfaces by removing services and patching the software regularly
      - implementing verification of the application traffic
      - whitelisting applications using tight policy rules
