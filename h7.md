<p>
  
  - The author of the source, Tero Karvinen, provides instructions and advise on where and how to find academic sources that can be used for thesis work
  
  - Suggests to start by using <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google Scholar</a>, a web search engine that searches specifically for academic sources such as articles, theses, books, and abstracts
  
  - Every result that catches your interest should have a Journal <a href="https://jfp.csc.fi">JUFO</a> level that is higher than 0 to verify that it has been peer reviewed
  
  - And one can find related articles with the help of <a href="https://www.connectedpapers.com">ConnectedPapers</a>, a tool that helps researchers and applied scientists to find and explore topic-relevant papers
  
  - According to the author, a good source for academic work should be published in a reputable location by a known author and peer reviewed using the JUFO rating
  
  - News paper articles, manual for programs, white papers, advertisements, or even popular books often times aren't peer reviewed academic sources
