Messages and Encryption

  - When a sender transmits a message to a receiver they should use encryption, a process of disguising the message to hide its substance
  - The message is transformed/encrypted from plaintext to ciphertext by the sender and decrypted to the original plaintext by the receiver
  - A cipher, a cryptographic algorithm, is a mathematical function used for the encryption and decryption
  - Cryptography = the art and science of keeping messages secure and allows for:
    - Authentication = ensuring who sent the message
    - Integrity = hindering any type of modification throughout the transmission
    - Nonrepudiation = assurance that the sender sent the message
  - Cryptanalysis = the art and science of breaking ciphertext by accessing the plaintext message without access to the key
  - Restricted algorithms base their security on keeping the details of how an algorithm works a secret
  - Modern cryptography uses keys instead; allowing for published and analyzed algorithms
  - Symmetric Algorithms such as Stream Algorithms or Block Algorithms allow for the encryption key to be calculated from the decryption key and the other way around. The encryption and decryption key are the same and the sender and receiver must agree on a secret key before starting to communicate with each other
  - Public-Key Algorithms, or Asymmetric Algorithms, use different keys for the encryption and decryption. One can't determine one key using the other. The encryption key used can be public, but the receiver is the only one that can decrypt the message.
  - General types of cryptanalytic attacks are:
    - Ciphertext-only attack
    - Known-plaintext attack
    - Chosen-plaintext attack
    - Adaptive-chosen-plaintext attack
